# 📑 Software Configuration Management (SCM) Journal
**Documenting my transition from coding to professional Engineering.**

### Entry 1: The Power of Version Control
* **Today's Goal:** Moving away from "saving files" to "managing releases."
* **Concept Learned:** Branching. I am learning that the `main` branch should always be stable (production-ready), while new features (like my Distributed Systems update) should live in a `feature-branch`.
* **Tooling:** Using Git to track changes and prevent data loss—a critical skill I value from my time managing backups at the National Treasury.

### Entry 2: AVD & Testing Lifecycle
* **Observation:** Using AVD (Android Virtual Device) allows me to test how code behaves in a simulated environment before it is ever committed to the final build.
