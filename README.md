# 🛡️ Gated Community Guest Monitoring System
**An Engineering-First approach to Residential Security**

A robust mobile solution built to manage visitor flow with high integrity and security. This project bridges the gap between traditional security and modern distributed software architecture.

## 🚀 Core Features & Coding Logic
* **Mobile Engine:** Built in **Java** via Android Studio, focusing on clean, modular code and intuitive UX.
* **Environment & Testing:** Rigorous validation performed using **Android Virtual Devices (AVD)**. I simulated various hardware specs to ensure stable performance across different Android API levels.
* **Database Integration:** High-volume logging managed via **MySQL**, optimized for fast retrieval using mathematical data processing logic.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Transition (Ongoing Study)
I am currently scaling this project from a local application to a **Distributed System**:
* **SCM Management:** Moving to a professional **Git Flow** strategy using branching for new feature deployment.
* **Distributed Architecture:** Re-designing the backend to support multi-gate synchronization, ensuring data consistency across the network.
* **Simulation & Modelling:** Implementing traffic flow simulations to predict and optimize gate-entry response times.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Java, SQL
* **Tools:** Android Studio, AVD, Git
* **Infrastructure:** Insights gained from ICT Security training at **The National Treasury**.
