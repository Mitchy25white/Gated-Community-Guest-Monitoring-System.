# 🛡️ Gated Community Guest Monitoring System
**An Engineering-First Approach to Residential Security & Data Integrity**

This project is a robust mobile solution designed to manage visitor flows with high security standards. It bridges the gap between traditional manual logging and modern, automated distributed software architecture.

## 🚀 Key Features & Coding Logic
* **Mobile Engine:** Built using **Java** in Android Studio, prioritizing modularity and clean code.
* **Rigorous Testing:** Performance validation executed via **Android Virtual Devices (AVD)** across multiple API levels to ensure UI/UX stability.
* **Database Management:** High-volume logging integrated with **MySQL**, optimized using mathematical processing for fast data retrieval.

## 🏗️ The Engineering Roadmap (Ongoing)
I am currently scaling this from a standalone app to a **Distributed System**:
* **Distributed Architecture:** Re-designing the backend to support multi-node synchronization (e.g., multiple estate gates sharing one real-time database).
* **SCM Implementation:** Adopting professional **Software Configuration Management** via Git to handle feature branching and version control.
* **Simulation & Modelling:** Utilizing simulation techniques to predict peak traffic and optimize system response times.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Languages:** Java, SQL (SSMS/MySQL),python, HTML5 and CSS
* **Mobile:** Android Studio, AVD, SDK Management
* **Networking:** CCNA Certified protocols for secure data transmission
* **Insights:** Built with security standards practiced during my tenure at **The National Treasury**.
